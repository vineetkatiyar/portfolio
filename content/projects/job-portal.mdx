## Excited to Announce My Latest Job Board Application!

I’m thrilled to share my new project – a robust job board application designed
for companies to easily post their job requirements. Here’s a quick overview:

### Live Demo and Source Code

- **Live Demo:** [Job Board Application](https://job-board-next-15.vercel.app)
- **GitHub Repository:** [Job Board on GitHub](https://github.com/vineetkatiyar/job-board)

### Job Posting & Admin Approval

- **Companies** can post their job requirements.
- **Admin** reviews each submission, with the option to approve or delete posts.
- **Secure Sign-In:** Admins must sign in using **Clerk Authentication** to
  perform these actions.

### Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15:** Built using the latest Next.js version for a dynamic,
  high-performance front-end.
- **PostgreSQL:** Robust database management, integrated via **Prisma ORM**.
- **Shadcn UI:** Provides a sleek and modern user interface.

### Advanced Features & Best Practices

- **Server Actions for Form Submission:** Utilized for efficient processing and
  reduced client-server round trips, making form submissions faster and more
  reliable.
- **Form Validation:** Implemented with **Zod** and **React Hook Form** for
  robust and accurate data handling.
- **File Uploads:** Managed seamlessly with **Vercel Blob**.
- **Content Enhancements:** Leveraged **React Markdown**,
  `generateStaticParams`, and dynamic metadata for improved content rendering
  and SEO.
- **TypeScript:** The entire project is developed in TypeScript for enhanced
  type safety and maintainability.
- **useFormStatus Hook:** Streamlines form state management for a smoother user
  experience.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Vercel** for fast and scalable deployment.
- **Pagination & Job Type Selection:** Users can filter job posts by types such
  as full-time, part-time, remote, internship, etc.

This project is a testament to modern web development practices and my
commitment to building scalable, user-friendly applications.

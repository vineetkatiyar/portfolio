# Scrilla.Club - Role-Based Affiliate E-Commerce

- **Live Demo:** [Scrilla.Club](https://scrilla.club)

[Scrilla.Club](https://scrilla.club) is a full-stack e-commerce platform
specializing in fashion, powered by a unique dual-role affiliate system. It goes
beyond traditional shopping by integrating a multi-tiered marketing structure
where users can participate as **Influencers** or **Agencies** to earn
commissions, turning customers into brand advocates.

### Core Technologies

1.  **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS
2.  **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
3.  **Database & ORM:** PostgreSQL, Prisma
4.  **Authentication:** JWT, bcryptjs
5.  **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, Redux Toolkit, useReducer)
6.  **Payments:** (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe, PayPal)

## Project Outline & Key Features

### 1. Introduction & Architecture

Overview of the project's unique value proposition and the technical stack
chosen to build a complex user hierarchy.

### 2. Application Setup & UI Foundation

Initialized the React application, set up routing, and implemented the core
layout using Tailwind CSS for a responsive design.

### 3. Database Schema Design with Prisma

Designed and implemented the complex PostgreSQL database models using Prisma
ORM. Key models include:

- `User` (with roles: `CUSTOMER`, `INFLUENCER`, `AGENCY`, `ADMIN`)
- `Passkey` (tracking global keys, parent-child relationships, and activation
  status)
- `Product`, `Order`, `OrderItem`
- `Commission` (to log every transaction in the referral chain)

### 4. Authentication & Authorization System

Built a secure JWT-based authentication flow that also handles role-based access
control (RBAC), ensuring Influencers, Agencies, and Admins access only their
permitted features.

### 5. Global Passkey Management (Admin)

Developed an admin interface to generate and distribute the global Influencer
and Agency passkeys. This is the seed for the entire referral network.

### 6. The Dual-Role Referral System

The core innovation of the project. Implemented the logic for:

- **Influencer Role:** Users who sign up with an Influencer passkey can refer
  others. They earn a **10% commission** on direct referrals' purchases.
- **Agency Role:** Users who sign up with an Agency passkey can recruit
  Influencers. They earn a **2% commission** on all sales made by their entire
  network of Influencers and sub-referrals.

### 7. Passkey Activation Workflow

Engineered the conditional activation system:

- Passkeys from the admin are active immediately.
- Passkeys from an Agency create active Influencer accounts.
- Passkeys from an Influencer are only activated after the new user's first
  purchase (e.g., of â‚¹10,000).

### 8. Real-Time Commission Engine

Created a backend service that triggers on every successful order payment. It
traverses the referral tree, calculates commissions for eligible parents
(Influencers and Agencies) based on the predefined percentages, and records them
in the database.

### 9. User Dashboard & Analytics

Built personalized dashboards for Influencers and Agencies to track their
earnings, view referral history, manage their passkeys, and monitor their
network's performance.

### 10. Product Catalog & Shopping Cart

Implemented the standard e-commerce features: product listings, filters, search,
and a persistent shopping cart.

### 11. Checkout & Payment Integration

Integrated a secure payment gateway (e.g., Razorpay) to handle transactions,
which also serves as the trigger event for commission distribution.

### 12. Order History & Management

Developed interfaces for users to view their order history and for admins to
manage orders and update their status.

This project was a significant exercise in full-stack development, requiring
deep collaboration between frontend and backend to solve complex problems
related to data relationships, financial calculations, and user lifecycle
management.

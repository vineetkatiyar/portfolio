Advanced dynamic filters:

# 💎 Product Details Page (My Most Important Work)

I built the highly dynamic and complex **product variant UI**, including:

- Variant images / videos  
- Metal type switcher

- Dynamic price calculation (real-time updates)  
- Real-time tax, GST & making charge calculation  
- Product specifications section

This was one of the most challenging parts because jewellery products have dozens of variant combinations.

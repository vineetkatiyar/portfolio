## Prisma Nested Queries

### A nested query allows you to read from, write to, or manipulate related models (relations) inside a single Prisma query.

- These are the main Nested Queries
  - Nested Read (include, select)
  - Nested Create
  - Nested Update
  - Nested Connect / Disconnect / Delete
  - Nested Upsert

1. ### Nested Read (include, select)
   **A query that fetches data from a model along with its related models using include or select.**

```js
const usersWithPosts = await prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    posts: true,
  },
});
```

- Explanation:
  - Fetches all users.
  - Each user includes their related posts.

---

2. ### Nested Create
   **Create a record in one model and simultaneously create related records in another model.**

```js
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    name: "Ravi",
    email: "ravi@example.com",
    posts: {
      create: [
        { title: "First Post", content: "Hello world" },
        { title: "Second Post", content: "Nested write is cool!" },
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

- Explanation:
  - Creates a new user.
  - Also creates two posts related to this user — in one query.

---

3. ### Nested UPDATE
   **Update a record and also update related records in one query.**

```js
const updatedUser = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: "user-id" },
  data: {
    name: "Updated Ravi",
    posts: {
      update: {
        where: { id: "post-id" },
        data: { title: "Updated Post Title" },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

- Explanation
  - Updates the user’s name.
  - Also updates a related post’s title.

---

4. ### Nested Upsert
   **If related record exists, update it; otherwise, create it.**

```js
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: "user-id" },
  data: {
    posts: {
      upsert: {
        where: { id: "post-id" },
        update: { title: "Updated Title" },
        create: { title: "New Title", content: "New Content" },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

- Explanation:
  - Checks if a post exists.
  - If it does: update title.
  - If it doesn’t: create a new one.

---

5. ### Nested Connect / Disconnect / Delete

```js
model User {
  id    String  @id @default(uuid())
  name  String
  posts Post[]
}

model Post {
  id       String  @id @default(uuid())
  title    String
  content  String?
  author   User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId String?
}
```

- ### connect: Link an existing record
   **You already have a User and a Post. You want to associate that post to the user.**

```js
await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: "post-id-123" },
  data: {
    author: {
      connect: { id: "user-id-abc" },
    },
  },
});
```

- What it does:
  - Finds the user with id = user-id-abc
  - Sets the authorId of this post to user-id-abc
---

- ### disconnect: Unlink the relationship, keep both records
**You want to remove the link between a post and its author, but don’t delete either.**

```js
await prisma.post.update({
  where: { id: "post-id-123" },
  data: {
    author: {
      disconnect: true,
    },
  },
});
```
- What it does:
    - Sets authorId = null on the Post (if allowed — needs relation to be optional).
    - The User and Post remain in the database.
    - ❗ IMPORTANT: authorId must be optional (String?) in your schema to allow disconnect.

- ### delete: Remove the related record entirely
**You want to delete the post related to a user.**
```js
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: "user-id-abc" },
  data: {
    posts: {
      delete: {
        id: "post-id-123",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

- What it does:
    - Deletes the Post with ID post-id-123 that belongs to this user.
    - Will fail if post doesn’t belong to this user.
